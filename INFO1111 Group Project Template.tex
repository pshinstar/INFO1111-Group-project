\section*{General Instructions}

You should use this \LaTeX\ template to generate your team project report. Keep in mind the following key points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item When we assess your report, you are not given a mark. Instead we will indicate (separately, for each team member) whether each level is ''achieved''.
    \item In order to pass the unit, you must achieve at least level 1. 
    \item In order to achieve level 2, you must first have achieved level 1, and so on for each level up to level 4. This means that we will not assess a higher level until a lower level has been achieved (though we will review one level higher and give you feedback to help you in refining your work).
    \item Some parts of the report are completed as a team and other parts require each student to complete a different section. This means that for each submission, some members of the team may have completed their work for a given section, but other members may not. It also is therefore possible that some members of the team may achieve a specified level and other members of the team may not yet have achieved that level.
    \item Even if some members are completing their material for a given level, and others are not, your team members will still need to work together to edit and compile the report.  The only exception to this is where a member of the team has already achieved the level they are targeting in a previous submission and has decided to not attempt higher levels, and so is not contributing any further (this should be obvious because no level is indicated for that student on the cover page).
    \item When completing each section you should remove the explanation text and replace it with your material.
\end{itemize}

For each submission you will add new details to this report, and/or update previous sections (where previous work was not good enough to have achieved the relevant level). In particular:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{General:} For each submission, each student can attempt up to 2 levels. You must also successfully achieve each lower level before you can be assessed at a higher level. For example, in the first submission you might attempt only level 1, but not be successful in achieving that level. You then reattempt level 1 and add in level 2 in the second submission and are successful in achieving level 1 but not level 2. For the third and final submission you could then attempt level 2, or levels 2 and 3 - or even just choose to not submit anything further and remain at level 1).
    \item \textbf{Submission 1:} You should complete at least the material for level 1 (since achieving level 1 is required to pass the unit). Each member of the team can also optionally choose to complete the material for level 2.\\
    \textit{Note 1: If you do not complete the level 2 information then you obviously cannot achieve level 2 at this stage. This does not stop you from attempting level 2 in Deliverable 2 or 3, but it will make it more difficult to achieve the higher levels later in the semester.}
    \textit{Note 2: To be able to achieve Level 1 in submission one your team has to achieve level 1 in the group component (Section 1.1) and you have to achieve Level 1 in the individual component (i.e. your assigned section 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 or 1.5)}
    \item \textbf{Submission 2:} Each member of your team will complete additional sections, but because you are submitting a single document, you need to work together to compile your results together and generate the final submission.\\
    If you did not achieve level 1 in your first submission, then you should revise the material for level 1 based on the feedback, and optionally you can also complete level 2.\\
    If you achieved level 1 in your first submission, then each team member can optionally complete the material for levels 2 and 3.
    \textit{Note: If you do not achieve level 1 with this submission then the highest level you will be able to achieve in the final submission will be level 2. If you achieve level 1, but not level 2, with this submission then the highest level you will be able to achieve with the final submission is level 3.}
    \item \textbf{Submission 3:} Again, you can correct sections where you did not achieve the specified level in the previous submission, and you complete additional sections.\\
    If you still have not achieved level 1, then you should revise the material for level 1 based on the feedback, and again optionally you can also complete level 2.\\
    For those at level 1, you can choose to complete the material for levels 2 and 3.\\
    For those at level 2, you can choose to complete the material for levels 3 and 4.\\
    For those at level 3, you can choose to complete the material for level 4.
\end{itemize}

Whilst the team project is just that -- a team project -- it has been designed to also allow different members of the team to achieve different outcomes. We do expect you to work together as a team. If you do come across problems working together then the first step should be to discuss this with your tutor. Note: If you are having problems you should approach your tutor as soon as you can to make them aware of the difficulties you are having with your team.

Finally, you should also ensure that any resources you use are suitably referenced, and references are included into the reference list at the end of this document. You should use APA 6th reference style \cite{apa6}.

\section{Level 1: Basic Skills}

Level 1 focuses on basic technical skills (related to \LaTeX\ and Git) and the types of skills used in different computing jobs.

\subsection{Developing industry skills}

This section is completed as a team.\\
Throughout your Computing degree we will help you learn a range of new skills. Once you graduate however you will need to continue to learn new languages, new tools, new applications, etc. For this section you need to identify 5 approaches you can take to this continual learning. You should then put these in order from most effective to least effective, and then explain the circumstances in which each approach might be appropriate. (Target = $\sim$100 words per skill = $\sim$500 words total).

\textbf{Efficient Workspace}

With the field of computing perpetually accelerating with new technology, a high level of self-discipline and autonomy is required to maintain a solid level of professionalism and to keep learnt skills in practice. As working at home has become a common phenomenon after 2020s, constructing an efficient workspace is key to improving productivity. Usually, keeping distractions out of reach and building a strong and focused mindset is the classic go-to, but that requires much self-control and would only come with time. Some other options would be going to cafes, libraries and even shared workspaces, as being in an environment where others are working encourages concentration.

\textbf{Personal Projects}

Besides being a library of codes displaying the skillset of a computer scientist, personal projects assist in the important task of keeping the myriad of languages used in practice. While everyone has their own opinion on the best language e.g. Python, C/C++, JavaScript for whatever task at hand, their variety of contradicting syntax requires practice to prevent re-learning of the language, wasting time and stalling advancement. Furthermore, the best way to show yourself and potential employers the level of your abilities in a particular coding language and particular field is to create a personal project.


\subsection{Skills: Dong Yoon Shin : Computer Science}

This section is completed individually. Each member of the team should independently complete a separate copy of this section.\\
You should begin by allocating to each team member a different major to focus on (i.e. one of: Computer Science; Data Science; Software Development; Cyber Security). \textit{If you have a fifth member, then your tutor will suggest a fifth topic to cover}. You should then undertake research into the typical practical skills that you believe would be most important to someone who graduates with this major and is then working in industry. You should list the 8 skills that you believe are most important and for each one give a short explanation as to why you feel it is important. (Target = $\sim$100 words per skill $\sim$800 words total per student).


\subsection{Skills: Li Sheng : Data Science}


\textbf{Communication}
While strong communication skills are crucial to essentially all lines of work, I feel it is especially important to data scientists. The role requires communicating information to team members/partners that may not have a data/computing background, as well as needing to understand the ‘problem’ that needs to be solved. As data scientists would usually work in teams, good communication would allow them to mesh into various team dynamics easily. Furthermore, as pure intuition would only go so far, good interpersonal skills would help probe stakeholders for more data, information, and key insights.

\textbf{Business Acumen}
Adding onto communication skills, business knowledge adds to the effectiveness of communication, making the process of problem solving much more efficient. As data scientists usually work to solve issues for businesses, business insight assists in understanding the key objectives and goals of the business, and thus the ability to create cost effective, easy to implement solutions which would ensure broad adoption. Furthermore, it is helpful in promoting business growth and exploring new business opportunities from a more data focused angle.

\textbf{Critical/Structured Thinking}
The core of data science requires deep curiosity and critical thinking, to solve problems and to find solutions, as data on its own does not mean much without processing and interpretation from data scientists. Alongside critical thinking, storytelling skills are also important, for example, the score of a live basketball game, on one side, it is displayed in the form of a table, the other side, as a bar chart, whereas the bar chart obviously being more intuitive, as it is human nature to prefer a more visual medium e.g. infographics, and it being the job of the data scientist display intricate data in a medium digestible to the average person.

\textbf{Programming}
Being a data scientist means communicating with machines, with programming languages such as Python, R and C/C++ as their tools. While they do not need to become the best at programming like software engineers do, they will need to be comfortable with it. The main role of programming languages for data scientists is to organise, analyse and visualise data, so having a library of different languages helps tackle this task from multiple angles. This also assists in filling basic team roles e.g. programming, frontend/backend engineering, which all computing roles would entail.

\textbf{Machine Learning/Deep Learning}
For data scientists working with mountains of organised and unorganised data, machines/deep learning builds predictive models and algorithms which effectively streamlines the organisation and prediction of data. This relatively emerging school of technology is not necessary for a data scientist but is a skill which would improve employability by automating the entire process by cleaning data and removing redundancies. Machine learning is also extremely malleable, being used in Fraud/Risk Detection Management, Healthcare, Airline Route Planning, Spam Filtering, Facial/Voice Recognition System, Interactive Voice Response, Comprehensive Language and Document Recognition and Translation.

\textbf{Big Data}
The growing ubiquity of the internet, social media and IoT has led to a sudden boom in the rate of data being generated, being up to 2.5 quintillion per day, new and innovative methods are required for data scientists to effectively organise this increasing load. This data is high in volume, velocity, and veracity. Organisations have been overwhelmed with such a large amount of data, and are trying to tackle this by rapidly adopting Big Data Technology such as Hadoop, Spark and Flink as frameworks to efficiently store and utilise the data when needed 

\textbf{Mathematics}
Any good data scientist needs a strong foundation on both maths and statistics, as any data driven business such as Google or YouTube will need a data scientist to understand different approaches to constructing a statistical model.  Multivariate Calculus and Linear Algebra are key subjects used to create machine learning models, which has emerged as a key principle of data science. The fundamental thought process required for math also contributes to the logical thinking skills required for all aspects of computing roles.

\textbf{Data Manipulation/Visualisation}
Data visualisation is a key component of being a data scientist, as you need to be able to effectively communicate information for proposed solution.  Data visualisation sits in between technical analysis and visual storytelling. As big data becomes increasingly integral to business operations, visualisation has become a crucial tool in making sense of the vast volumes of data generated daily. The ability to break down complex data into smaller, digestible pieces by using a variety of visual aids like charts and graphs is key for data scientists to advance career wise.

\section{Level 2: Basic Technology}

Level 2 focuses on initial evaluation of the tech stack that is used by a selected company. All companies make use of a range of technologies, and these technologies need to work together. A tech stack is basically just this collection of technologies that collectively enable a company's systems. As an example, one of the most common technology stacks for supporting web servers is LAMP: Linux as the underlying operating system; Apache as a web server; MySQL as the supporting database; and Perl (or more recently PHP or Python) as the programming language.

Each student should choose a different tech stack and explain the role of each of the different technologies in that stack. Note that prior to researching your proposed tech stack and spending time writing about it, it might be a good idea to check with your tutor as to whether your chosen stack is suitable. (Target = $\sim$200-400 words per student).
